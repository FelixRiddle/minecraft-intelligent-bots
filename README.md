# Minecraft intelligent bots

An app to create intelligent bots in minecraft.

Main purposes of this project:
- No cheat

Most bots have x-ray because they get whole chunk data in their view, this is the default for minecraft, however I want my bots to play fair, not use these characteristics.

- Be intelligent

I want them to act in basis of the environment, specific roles(e.g: combat, miners, etc), and [Swarm behavior].

For [Swarm behavior] there are two main ways to communicate:
* [Cheating]
Through this package

We will start doing it this way first.

* [In game]
Through the /whisper command

I'd like this way, however it may be too hard to do.

# Personal note

Consider mineflayer a 'bridge'

My library hast to be singular, and it's through 'bridges'(packages, apis, etc) that I get my library to translate actions to the actual game.

This is a concept I often fail to realize
